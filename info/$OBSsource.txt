Parameter(s)
--------------------------------------------

$OBSsource("<source>", "<rendered>")
$OBSsource("<source>", "<rendered>", "<scene>")

--------------------------------------------
Description
--------------------------------------------

Enable or disable a given source in the current active scene if the optional scene
name is not given. If the scene name is given it tries to enable the given source
in that scene, regardless if the scene or source exists.

  <source>

    The source name to enable or disable.
    This is a required argument and cannot be empty. The name has to match the source
    name in OBS and is therefore case sensitive. All characters can be used except
    names containing single (') or double (") quotes for this parameter.

  <rendered>

    Determines the rendered state (visibility/enabled) of the set source.
    This is a required argument but can be empty. The set source will be rendered if
    this argument is 'true' (non case-sensitive). Anything else, results in a not
    rendered state, thus not visibile.

  <scene>

    The scene name to enable or disable the source in.
    This is a optional argument and cannot be empty. The name has to match the scene
    name in OBS and is therefore case sensitive. All characters can be used except
    names containing single (') or double (") quotes for this parameter.
